/** \brief "Formal" linear operator.

  This class template is used as a base class for all implementations of
  various types of linear operators, in particular integral operators.

  A LinearOperator represents a linear mapping \f$L : X \to Y\f$, where \f$X :
  S \to K^p\f$ and \f$Y : T \to K^q\f$ are function spaces, with \f$S\f$
  standing for an \f$n\f$-dimensional surface and \f$T\f$ either equal to
  \f$S\f$ or to a \f$(n+1)\f$-dimensional domain in which \f$S\f$ is embedded.
  \f$K\f$ denotes either the set of real or complex numbers.

  The operator is called "formal" because its domain \f$X\f$ is not specified
  yet. The functions assembleWeakForm() and assembleOperator() construct "true"
  linear operators acting on functions from the space passed as the trialSpace
  parameter.

  \tparam ValueType      Type used to represent elements of \f$K\f$. This can be
                         one of: float, double, std::complex<float> and
                         std::complex<double>.
